Title: Building a Simple Calculator with JavaScript

Abstract: This technical note provides a step-by-step guide for building a simple calculator using JavaScript. It includes code snippets and explanations for each step of the process, from creating the HTML and CSS structure to implementing the calculator's functionality using JavaScript.

Introduction: A calculator is a basic tool used to perform mathematical operations such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. Building a calculator using JavaScript is a useful exercise for developers who want to learn more about the language and its capabilities. This technical note will provide guidance on how to create a simple calculator using JavaScript, with a focus on best practices for structuring and organizing the code.

Best Practices:

HTML and CSS: The first step in building a calculator is to create the HTML and CSS structure. This should include a container for the calculator display, as well as buttons for each of the mathematical operations. It is important to use clean and well-structured HTML and CSS code to ensure that the calculator is easy to read and understand.

JavaScript Functions: The next step is to create the JavaScript functions that will perform the mathematical operations. These functions should take in two numbers as input and return the result of the operation.

Event Listeners: Once the functions are created, event listeners should be added to the calculator buttons to trigger the functions when the buttons are clicked. These event listeners can be added using the addEventListener() method in JavaScript.

Error Handling: It is important to include error handling in the calculator to prevent unexpected results or errors. This can be done by checking the input values for NaN (not a number) or other errors, and providing appropriate error messages or responses
